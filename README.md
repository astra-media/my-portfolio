# Portfolio

## About this Project

This portfolio website, built with Next.js and exported as a static site, showcases my recent projects as a full-stack web developer and software engineer.

The objective of this project was to create a comprehensive display of my work from the past few years. I aimed for a minimalist UI, employing contemporary web technologies that are highly relevant in today's development landscape.

The site features a simple navigation structure. Rather than multiple pages, I opted for a single-page layout. I used reference elements for smooth scrolling and modals to display content, ensuring a clutter-free interface.

To enhance user experience, I integrated GSAP for seamless element transitions. Swiper.js was used for image showcasing, providing an excellent touch slider experience. React PDF Viewer ensures that PDF documents are displayed correctly across all devices, including iOS, PC, and Android.
